# iconSteal
I saw @moldyMacaroniX on twitter request a mod like this, so I quickly put this together!
Its a simple icon stealer. nothing else to really say
Plans: 

- settings, like only being able to use ublocked icons (its an hbg1010 mod, if it doesnt depend on settings why bother)
- clean up copy+ UI
- Make Moreicons have propper compatibility
- make code better idk how but somehow

If you need support, dm me @hbg1010 on discord, or @hbghbg1010 on twitter
